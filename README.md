# Heap
Heap sort is a comparison based sorting technique based on Binary Heap data structure.
It is similar to selection sort where we first find the maximum element and place the maximum element at the end.
Heap sort is an in-place algorithm. Time Complexity: 
Time complexity of heapify is O(Logn). 
Time complexity of createAndBuildHeap() is O(n) 
and overall time complexity of Heap Sort is O(nLogn).
